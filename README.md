# Library Database Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Library Management Database using SQL. 
It includes four main tables: **Authors**, **Books**, **Borrowers**, and **Loans**, showcasing relational database concepts such as primary keys, foreign keys, and data integrity. 
Sample data has been inserted to allow testing of queries and relationships, making it suitable for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features
- Authors, Books, Borrowers, and Loans tables
- Foreign key relationships (Books → Authors, Loans → Books & Borrowers)
- Sample data inserts for testing
- Example SQL queries included to verify data

## How to Run
1. Open MySQL (or phpMyAdmin) on your system.
2. Run the file `librarydb.sql` to create the database and tables.
3. Verify data with queries like:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Authors;
   SELECT * FROM Books;
   SELECT * FROM Loans;
   ```
