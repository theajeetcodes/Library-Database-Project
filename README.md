# Library Database Project

## Overview
This is a SQL-based Library Management Database project.  
It contains tables for **Authors**, **Books**, **Borrowers**, and **Loans**, demonstrating relational design and sample data handling.

## Features
- Authors, Books, Borrowers, and Loans tables
- Foreign key relationships (Books → Authors, Loans → Books & Borrowers)
- Sample data inserts for testing
- Simple example queries to verify data

## How to Run
1. Open MySQL (or phpMyAdmin) on your system.
2. Run the file `librarydb.sql` (or `librarydb_full.sql`) to create the database and tables:
   ```sql
   SOURCE path/to/librarydb.sql;

mysql -u <username> -p < librarydb.sql

SELECT * FROM Authors;
SELECT * FROM Books;
SELECT * FROM Loans;

Again sorry for the confusion — galti ho gayi. Agar tum paste karke commit kar do to main turant check karke bata dunga agar aur koi chhota tweak karna ho (badge, table schema snippet, ya screenshot add karna). Chill — main ab bilkul seedha solution de diya.
